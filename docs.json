[{"name":"Scene3d","comment":" Top-level functionality for rendering a 3D scene.\n\nNote that the way `elm-3d-scene` is designed, functions in this module are\ngenerally 'cheap' and can safely be used in your `view` function directly. For\nexample, you can safely have logic in your `view` function that enables and\ndisables lights, moves objects around by translating/rotating/mirroring them,\nor even changes the material used to render a particular object with. In\ncontrast, creating meshes using the functions in the [`Mesh`](Scene3d-Mesh)\nmodule is 'expensive'; meshes should generally be created once and then stored\nin your model.\n\n@docs unlit, cloudy, sunny, custom\n\n\n# Entities\n\n@docs Entity\n\n\n## Basic shapes\n\n`elm-3d-scene` includes a handful of basic shapes which you can draw directly\nwithout having to create and store a separate [`Mesh`](Scene3d-Mesh). In\ngeneral, for most of the basic shapes you can specify whether or not it should\ncast a shadow (assuming there is shadow-casting light in the scene!) and can\nspecify a material to use. However, different shapes support different kinds of\nmaterials:\n\n  - `quad`s and `sphere`s support all materials, including textured ones.\n  - `block`s, `cylinder`s, `cone`s and `facet`s only support uniform\n    (non-textured) materials.\n  - `point`s, `lineSegment`s and `triangle`s only support plain materials\n    (solid colors or emissive materials).\n\nNote that you _could_ render complex shapes by (for example) mapping\n`Scene3d.triangle` over a list of triangles, but this would be inefficient; if\nyou have a large number of triangles it is much better to create a mesh using\n[`Mesh.triangles`](Scene3d-Mesh#triangles) or similar, store that mesh either in\nyour model or as a top-level constant, and then render it using [`Scene3d.mesh`](#mesh).\nFor up to a few dozen individual entities (points, line segments, triangles etc)\nit should be fine to use these convenience functions, but for much more than\nthat you will likely want to switch to using a proper mesh for efficiency.\n\n@docs point, lineSegment, triangle, facet, quad, block, sphere, cylinder, cone\n\n\n## Shapes with shadows\n\nThese functions behave just like their corresponding non-`WithShadow` versions\nbut make the given object cast a shadow (or perhaps multiple shadows, if there\nare multiple shadow-casting lights in the scene).

For example, you could draw a single entity and then\ndraw several more translated versions of it:\n\n![Translation of 3D entities](https://ianmackenzie.github.io/elm-3d-scene/images/1.0.0/translation.png)\n\nThe following examples all use this duckling as the original (untransformed)\nentity:\n\n![Duckling with no transformation](https://ianmackenzie.github.io/elm-3d-scene/images/1.0.0/duckling-original.png)\n\n@docs rotateAround, translateBy, translateIn, scaleAbout, mirrorAcross\n\n\n# Background\n\n@docs Background, transparentBackground, backgroundColor\n\n\n# Antialiasing\n\n@docs Antialiasing\n\n@docs noAntialiasing, multisampling, supersampling\n\n\n# Lights\n\n@docs Lights\n\nThe following functions let you set up lighting using up to eight lights.

This can let you do things like render a high-poly\ndoor while rendering its shadow using a simpler approximate shape like a quad or\nrectangular block to reduce rendering time (rendering shadows of complex\nmeshes can be expensive).\n\nNote that if you do something like this then you will need to be careful to make\nsure that the approximate object fits _inside_ the actual mesh being rendered -\notherwise you might end up with the object effectively shadowing itself.\n\n@docs triangleShadow, quadShadow, blockShadow, sphereShadow, cylinderShadow, coneShadow, meshShadow\n\n\n## Customized rendering\n\n@docs composite, toWebGLEntities\n\n","unions":[{"name":"Antialiasing","comment":" An `Antialiasing` value defines what (if any) kind of [antialiasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing)\nis used when rendering a scene.
