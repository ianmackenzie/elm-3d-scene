module Meshes exposing (main)

{-| If you want to create complex shapes and render them efficiently, you will
likely need to create your own Mesh values. This example illustrates how to
create a mesh from scratch; in your own apps you might generate meshes
programmatically using some geometry-generation logic, or parse them from some
file format.

{-| Declare a coordinate system type (many apps will only need a single
"world coordinates" type, but you can call it whatever you want)

{-| Define a pyramid shape to render. The 'Mesh.Uniform' type refers to a mesh
that does not have UV (texture) coordinates and therefore cannot have textures
applied to it, but _does_ have normal vectors defined and can therefore use
materials that involve lighting (in addition to materials like 'constant color'
which ignore lighting). Once created, a Mesh value should generally be stored
in your model and reused from frame to frame.
